# Changelog

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-17)

- `report` copies every referenced `proofs.json` into `<DIR>/ledger/` next
  to the report (`--no-proofs` to skip), so the hand-over needs nothing from
  the ledger directory itself.
- `report.html`: tables fit A4; undefined template variables are errors.
- `setup.sh --pdf` installs WeasyPrint hash-pinned from `requirements-pdf.lock`.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-17)

- First release: `history`, `block`, `balance`, `report`. Reports with
  opening/closing balances, movements, reconciliation, proof coverage from a
  bip322-audit ledger (re-verified at report time), node cross-check, optional
  fiat valuation from user-supplied rates; HTML, CSV, optional PDF.
- Requires `bip322-audit>=0.6` (for `snapshot --skip-proven` and the ledger
  helper) and therefore `bip322-core>=0.5`.
